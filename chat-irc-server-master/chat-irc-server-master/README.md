Chat IRC server
===============

An IRC-style chat server written in Java. You can find the client here: [chat-irc-client](https://github.com/odarriba/chat-irc-client).

It uses a binary protocol very similar (but not compatible) to original IRC protocol.

It supports multiple users, rooms and simultaneous messages. Also, it implements memory-efficient methods to support large number of users concurrently.

Source code
-----------
The source code was written during a subject in the [University of Oviedo](http://www.uniovi.es) (Computer architecture). It's mainly written in English but commented in Spanish.

It implements the basic input/output layers in network and user side. Also, a basic GUI is also available.
